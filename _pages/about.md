Lingxi Jin (玲僖) is a Ph.D. candidate in Educational Technology at Ewha Womans University, supervised by Professor Hyo-Jeong So. Her research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence in education (AIED), human-AI interaction, and learning analytics. Her research explores how large language models (LLMs) can mediate human-AI collaboration for knowledge co-construction and support self-directed learning in AI mediated environments. Building on her interest in AI-enhanced education, she is currently designing intelligent tutoring systems and teachable agents, both powered by large language models (LLMs), to improve learning experiences through advanced AI technologies. She employs learning analytics methods such as Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to analyze learner-AI interactions and uncover patterns of cognitive and metacognitive engagement.
Lingxi holds a Master’s degree in Educational Technology from Ewha Womans University and has contributed to multiple national research projects on AI-based recommendation systems and engineering education reform. Her recent research has been accepted at leading conferences, including CHI 2025, AIED 2025 (CORE A), and ICLS 2025.
Driven by a passion to design equitable and reflective learning environments, she aspires to bridge research and practice by building AI-augmented educational systems that empower diverse learners across disciplines.

**Exploring the Impact of an LLM-Powered Teachable Agent**

🔹 **Project Period**: 2024.01 – Present  
🔹 **Team**: **Lingxi Jin**, Baicheng Lin, Mengze Hong, Kun Zhang, Hyo-Jeong So  

The goal of this project is to explore how learners engage in knowledge co-construction when teaching an LLM-powered agent (Chat Melody) to solve music theory problems. This project draws upon the Learning-by-Teaching (LBT) paradigm and leverages large language models to simulate a curious novice agent. By teaching the agent, learners engage in deeper reflection, strategic problem-solving, and more effective knowledge organization. Chat Melody provides multimodal interaction, including visual sheet music, auditory cues, and dialogic support. It has been evaluated in the context of harmonic analysis and musical form identification. The project also investigates cognitive load, motivation, and sequential learning behaviors using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA).

**Design and Evaluation of Recommender Systems for Educational Artificial Intelligence Platforms:  
Focusing on Preference-consistent and Preference-inconsistent Recommendation Methods**

🔹 **Project Period**: 2020.06 – 2022.08  
🔹 **Funding**: Korea Research Foundation  
🔹 **Team**: Hyo-Jeong So, Hye-ran Lee, **Lingxi Jin**, Joo-Young Song, Woo-Rin Hwang, Hye-Ji Jang  

Recently, the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI)-based educational platforms has diversified the ways in which learners understand AI technologies. However, many of these platforms fail to provide accurate information about the technologies they use, often describing features in abstract or overly promotional terms. As a result, users face difficulties in selecting appropriate learning tools.  To address this issue, it is essential to develop a system that can recommend content tailored to individual learners’ characteristics and needs. This study aims to propose a participatory recommendation mechanism in which learners are not merely passive users of the system but also act as information providers. In addition, it applies both *preference-consistent* and *preference-inconsistent* recommendation strategies—those that reflect learners’ existing preferences and those that introduce new learning opportunities, respectively—to examine how each type of recommendation affects the learning experience.

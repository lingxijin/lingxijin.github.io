**Lingxi Jin (金玲僖)** is a Ph.D. candidate in Educational Technology at Ewha Womans University, supervised by Professor Hyo-Jeong So. Her research sits at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), and Learning Analytics. Her research integrates large language models (LLMs) into AI-enhanced learning environments, drawing on principles of learning design to scaffold meaningful learner–AI interactions and promote cognitive engagement. She investigates how LLMs can mediate human–AI collaboration to foster knowledge co-construction and support self-directed learning in AI-augmented contexts.

Motivated by a commitment to improving learning experiences through advanced technologies, Lingxi is currently designing intelligent tutoring systems and teachable agents powered by LLMs. To analyze the dynamics of learner–AI interaction, she employs learning analytics methods such as Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA).

She received her Master’s degree in Educational Technology from Ewha Womans University, where she built a strong foundation in instructional design, learning analytics, and AI-enhanced education. She has since contributed to several national research projects on Recommendation Systems for Education and engineering education reform. Her recent work has been accepted at leading international conferences, including CHI 2025, AIED 2025, and ICLS 2025.

Outside of research, she enjoys scuba diving, traveling, and discovering new places and perspectives.

**Exploring the Impact of an LLM-Powered Teachable Agent**

🔹 **Project Period**: 2024.01 – Present  
🔹 **Team**: **Lingxi Jin**, Baicheng Lin, Mengze Hong, Kun Zhang, Hyo-Jeong So  
🔹 **Role**: Project Manager  

The goal of this project is to explore how learners engage in knowledge co-construction when teaching an LLM-powered agent (Chat Melody) to solve music theory problems. This project draws upon the Learning-by-Teaching (LBT) paradigm and leverages large language models to simulate a curious novice agent. By teaching the agent, learners engage in deeper reflection, strategic problem-solving, and more effective knowledge organization. Chat Melody provides multimodal interaction, including visual sheet music, auditory cues, and dialogic support. It has been evaluated in the context of harmonic analysis and musical form identification. The project also investigates cognitive load, motivation, and sequential learning behaviors using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA).

**Design and Evaluation of Recommender Systems for Educational Artificial Intelligence Platforms:Focusing on Preference-consistent and Preference-inconsistent Recommendation Methods**

🔹 **Project Period**: 2020.06 – 2022.08  
🔹 **Funding**: National Research Foundation  
🔹 **Team**: Hyo-Jeong So, Hye-ran Lee, **Lingxi Jin**, Joo-Young Song, Woo-Rin Hwang, Hye-Ji Jang  
🔹 **Role**: Project Researcher   

Recently, the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI)-based educational platforms has diversified the ways in which learners understand AI technologies. However, many of these platforms fail to provide accurate information about the technologies they use, often describing features in abstract or overly promotional terms. As a result, users face difficulties in selecting appropriate learning tools.  To address this issue, it is essential to develop a system that can recommend content tailored to individual learners’ characteristics and needs. This study aims to propose a participatory recommendation mechanism in which learners are not merely passive users of the system but also act as information providers. In addition, it applies both *preference-consistent* and *preference-inconsistent* recommendation strategies—those that reflect learners’ existing preferences and those that introduce new learning opportunities, respectively—to examine how each type of recommendation affects the learning experience.
